# Methods

## Food-web generation

- Niche model
- Number of replicates: 100

## Experiments

### Scenario

- 3 scenario that follows each other (i.e. ordered):
  1. The predator is present
  2. We removed the top predator (species with the highest trophic level has its
     biomass sets to 0)
  3. We incorporate back the predator with an initial biomass equals to the
     average biomass of the other species

We simulated the dynamic of each food-web until that we reached a steady state
(sum of biomass derivatives < 10^-6). We then simulated again the community at
steady state for 300 timesteps and collected the last 200 timesteps to
compute the community metrics.

We then performed three experiments to see how the various context of the
ecological communities affects the result of the reintroduction.

### Complexity: connectance and richness

- Initial connectance: `r unique(param_CS$C)`
- Initial richness: `r unique(param_CS$S)`

### Predator size


### Predator generality

### Predator propagule size

## Data analysis

- Richness, persistence
- Average interaction strength, average per capita interaction strength
- Stability:
  - Community stability (1 / CV)
  - Average population stability: 1 / weighted mean of population CV
  - Mean population stability: 1 / mean of population CV


For each of the metrics above, we computed the effect of (1) extirpation, (2)
reintroduction after expirpation, and the effect of reintroduction relative to
the original community (3). For each of the metrics, we then computed:

1. Extirpation effect: extirpation - predator present
2. Reintroduction effect: reintroduction - extirpation
3. Resilience effect: reintroduction - predator present

# Result

```{r}
toby_res_cap <- "Mean population stability, community stability and weighted
average population stability according to initial species richness
and initial connectance. The colors are according to the timeline: predator
present, extirpated or reintroduced" %>%
  str_replace_all("\\s+", " ")
```


```{r toby, fig.cap = toby_res_cap}
knitr::include_graphics(here("report", "figs", "p_toby_res.png"))
```

It is more blurry when we look at community stability and weighted average
population stability.


```{r}
reintro_effect_cap <- "Effects of retrointroduction on community metrics.
Computed as (reintroduction - extirpation) / extirpation." %>%
  str_replace_all("\\s+", " ")

extirp_effect_cap <- "Effects of extirpation on community metrics.
Computed as (extirpation - predator present) / predator present." %>%
  str_replace_all("\\s+", " ")

resilience_effect_cap <- "Effects of resilience on community metrics.
Computed as (reintroduction - predator present) / reintroduction." %>%
  str_replace_all("\\s+", " ")

```


```{r reintro-eff, fig.cap = reintro_effect_cap}
knitr::include_graphics(here("report", "figs", "p_reintro_effect.png"))
```

```{r extirp-eff, fig.cap = extirp_effect_cap}
